## ⚙️ How It Works

- Each user joining the application is assigned a unique identifier, display name, and color.
- Drawing actions are captured locally and broadcast in real time using WebSocket-based channels.
- All connected clients apply updates immediately to maintain a synchronized canvas state.
- Cursor positions are shared to show live movement of other users on the canvas.
- Undo, redo, and clear actions are synchronized across all participants.

## 🎯 Design Decisions

* Real-time communication optimized for low latency
* Separation of canvas logic from UI components
* Type-safe implementation using TypeScript
* Modular custom hooks to manage drawing and synchronization
* Minimal backend complexity for easier scalability

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* No authentication or persistent user accounts
* Single shared canvas session
* Canvas state is not persisted across reloads
* No export functionality

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* User authentication and profiles
* Multiple rooms or session-based canvases
* Shape, text, and selection tools
* Export canvas as image or SVG
* Persistent canvas storage
